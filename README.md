1. Introduction
This documentation outlines a Java chatbot program designed to simulate a conversation with users. The chatbot responds to specific queries and engages in basic interactions based on predefined rules and responses.

2. Code Overview
The chatBot class contains the main method and functionalities for the chatbot. It utilizes a Scanner for user input and responds to various questions and statements.

3. Functionality
The chatbot provides responses to the following queries:

Greeting ("hi", "hello")
Inquiry about the chatbot ("who are you?", "who are you")
Inquiry about the chatbot's well-being ("how are you?", "how are you")
Acronym query ("what is the full form of bot?")
Personalized question ("what is my name?")
Internship query ("any internship opportunities for btech students?")
Gratitude ("thank you")
Exit command ("exit")

4. Usage
Users can interact with the chatbot by entering queries or statements. The chatbot responds accordingly based on predefined rules. For example:

User: "hi"
Bot: "Hello"
User: "who are you?"
Bot: "I am bot"
User: "thank you"
Bot: "You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

5. Error Handling
The chatbot currently does not have extensive error handling. It operates based on exact matching of user input with predefined responses. If the input does not match any predefined queries, the chatbot will not provide a response.

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Java chatbot provides a simple yet effective way to engage in basic conversations. Its functionality covers common queries and interactions, making it suitable for introductory chatbot applications. Further enhancements could include more robust error handling, context-aware responses, and integration with external APIs for broader functionality.
