/*Develop a java chatbot capable of engaging in conversation with users. The chatbot should understand natural language input and respond appropriately, providing relevant information or
assistance.Utilize natural language processing techniques to enhance the bot's ability to interpret user queries accurately. Ensure the chatbot's responses are contextually relevant and 
contribute to a seamless user experience.Additionally, Imagine you've been tasked with creating comprehensive documentation for a java Chatbot project.Your documentation should include
detailed explanations of the code along with images illustrating the program's execution and user interactions.*/
